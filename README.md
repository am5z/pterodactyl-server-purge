# Pterodactyl Server Purger

![](https://i.imgur.com/bfuUhIy.png)

It's really quite simple. You put your Pterodactyl credentials in and do the settings, servers get deleted except ones with the keyword in them.

To start it, do `npm start` like any other Node.js app. This probably works with Pelican too.

**There is a web version hosted on Vercel: [https://pterodactyl-server-purge.vercel.app/](https://pterodactyl-server-purge.vercel.app/)** If you don't trust that your Pterodactyl keys are safe, self host it instead.
